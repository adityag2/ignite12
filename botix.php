               Introduction:-<br />

Set your rudders, gun your propellers and cut through choppy waves in this one of a kind Radio/Manual controlled boat race event. <br />
Use your craftiness to make a simple RC/Manual sail boat and run it in a competition to outpace and outmaneuver your competitor.<br />
<br />
Task:-<br />

Design and construct a remote controlled robot capable of running on water surface and Hit the Ball and can hit the ball in Goal in minimum time.<br />
<br />
Specifications:-<br />

Dimensions and Fabrications<br />

1)The machine should fit in a box of dimension 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm (l*b*h) at every given point of the race. The external device used to control the machine such as remote control box or DC converter is not included in the size constraint.<br />

2) The boat has to be controlled by a wireless/wired remote control mechanism throughout the competition.<br />

3) The boat must not be made from Lego parts, or any readymade assembly kits.<br />

4) Remote control systems from toys might be used. Remote control systems available in the market may also be used.<br />

5) Balsa wood or fiber glass or any other light in weight but strong material can be used for the construction.<br /><br />

Robot Control Requirements<br />

1) The machine can be controlled wirelessly. Off board power supplies are allowed. Refer below for further details on battery and power.<br />

2) Remote control systems from toys might be used. Remote control systems available in the market may also be used.<br />
<br />
Motor specifications<br />

1) The boat can have an external D.C supply or an on board power supply to provide power to any mechanism requiring electric power.<br />

2) Only dc motor should be used for the power supply.<br />
<br />
Battery and Power<br />

1) The machine can be powered electrically only. Use of an IC engine in any form is not allowed. 
On board Batteries must be sealed, immobilized-electrolyte types (such as gel cells, lithium, NiCad, NiMH, or dry cells).<br />

2) Use of damaged, non-leak proof batteries may lead to disqualification. Maximum D.C power permitted is 24 Volts.<br />
<br />
Safety Rules:-<br />

Compliance with all event rules is mandatory. It is expected that competitors stay within the rules and procedures of their own accord and do not require constant policing<br />

1) The machine you build would be first checked for size and safety.<br />

2) The machine should not cause electrical power breakdown.<br />

3) The robot must not contain any combustible, corrosive, or otherwise dangerous materials.<br />

4) Explosive, compressive or expansive, either internal or external is not permitted.<br />

ANY ROBOT WHOSE STRATEGY OR OPERATION IS CONSIDERED DANGEROUS CAN BE DISQUALIFIED BY THE JUDGES AT THEIR DISCRETION.<br />

Team Specification College teams: A team may consist of a maximum of 4 participants.<br />

A Inclined Surface Climbing Robo Competition.<br />
Task:-<br />
Design and construct a remote controlled robot capable of running on Inclined Surface (at an angle of 10 deg.) and capable to run on irregular surface with or without Load (weight in cart).<br />
<br />
Dimensions and Fabrications<br />
1)The machine should fit in a box of dimension 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm (l*b*h) at every given point of the race. The external device used to control the machine such as remote control box or DC converter is not included in the size constraint.<br />
2) The bot has to be controlled by a wireless/wired remote control mechanism throughout the competition.<br />
3) The bot must not be made from Lego parts, or any readymade assembly kits.<br />
4) Remote control systems from toys might be used. Remote control systems available in the market may also be used.<br />
5) Aluminium Chassis or fiber glass or Plastic sheet or any other light in weight but strong material can be used for the construction.<br />
<br />
Robot Control Requirements<br />
1) The machine can be controlled wirelessly. Off board power supplies are allowed. Refer below for further details on battery and power.<br />
2) Remote control systems from toys might be used. Remote control systems available in the market may also be used.<br />

<br />
General Guidelines<br />
The rules for design are very flexible in order to generate maximum technological creativity. The competition will evaluate each robot's performance in climbing a Inclined Surface constructed of different materials and obstacles of various dimensions. Each student group will have an opportunity to practice with the Arena prior to the competition. Judges will score each robot in five functional areas: Utility, navigation, versatility, speed, and innovation. The functional areas will specifically measure the robot's ability to complete the following tasks: <br />
Utility: Carry a load in proportion to its own body weight. <br />
Navigation: Complete the Task without touching obstacles on the Arena Surface.<br /> 
Versatility: Climb up surfaces composed of different materials and constructed in various shapes and sizes. <br />
Speed: Run up the full length of the Arena Surface from bottom to top in any manner as quickly as possible. <br />
Innovation: Demonstrate unique capabilities, innovative use of technology, general creativity, or style. <br />

The surface, as depicted, will be used to test the robot's performance in navigation, versatility, and speed. (The utility and innovation tasks will be performed independently.) <br />
The Arena is made of on plywood, and contains three sections composed of different materials and obstacles. <br />
The first section, closest to the floor, contain a wooden ramp (at 10 deg angle) surface, two obstacles.<br />
 The second section, in the middle of the wall, contains an rough surface and three obstacles.<br />
 The third section, at the top of the wall, contains an irregular sufaces, and two obstacles.<br />
