-Richard Feynman<br>
Engineering is all about imagination and genuine creativity. It relies on the innovative and Intrinsic thinking, basic logic, common sense rather than just Concepts and their application. It all needs a spark, to "Ignite" the grey matter inside your brain, to bring forth the Supreme creativeness,
imagination to bring forth the unparalleled Technology.  <br>
 IGNITE as the name suggests we're trying to set ablaze technology on fire with creative ideas, nurtured thoughts, to create an aura of Knowledge, scientific ideas and Technology. It is a very genuine attempt to give respect and foster the symbiotic relationship between man and Technology. <br>
In its utmost quest to provide a bigger platform to the engineering minds to showcase their talents and skill sets in mind-boggling competitions, display cutting edge technology and provide simple yet effective solutions to problems faced by us by common man, IGNITE is an effort to bring forth
one of the most enlightened minds, provide students a chance to reach the zenith of technical perfection and make a whole new army of inspired engineers.
